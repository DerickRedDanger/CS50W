finish creating the javascript and css for clicked buttons, 
    (state-2, state-3, clicks-0, clicks-1, clicks-2) as well as a :active for all buttons
    add the funtion to all button and the classes state-2/3 depending of the case

finish setting the todo's list

Remove all the javascript funtcions inside the html (like on click) and separate them into the script.

create a search function for the sidebar in the test. 
maybe create a sort function that sort two datasets at once

Add the sidenav to all views, namely a right one that shows all objects to event/task/listtodo
and modify the all todo from the index into a left sidenav

on the sidenav of the dailytask, create a mini planner that shows all dailytask of the week on their
time frame in the planner

Add a active/inactive to model.events (and possibly to others) to differenciate events that already passed
(if it doesn't have repetitions or if the last repetition already passed) from the ones yet to come.

create a filter and sort button for the all list to do in the index

create a windged to events,dailytask and listtodo that shows all of it's objects.

event rework complete, need to create validations to ensure the specific repetitions and util
are after the day of the even and not null.





Create   the add to today's task so that it also updates the added tasks last update date

Create the filter and sort function for all list to do in the index{
    sort_order=[]
    onchange: check if this button is in the sort_order:
        if it's: remove
        if it's not: append to the end of it
        if sort leng is higher than 3, remove one.
    Runs Sort(sort_order[0],sort_order[1],sort_order[2])

    Sort (first sort, second, third):
        sort based on the first.
        sort the ones with the same first (maybe same priority), than move to the next one with different ones
        repeat till all are done.
        if the sort isn't in sort_order: do nothing
}

create a auto function to set the progress of stuff to do that hasn't being done, modified
or added to dotoday in a week to forgotten (maybe add a configuration to change this value)'

--- when adding the snackbar, create the below

Gotta add a function that checks the datetime of the day selected and asks if
they want at that day number or at that weekday of the month
(like the second monday of the month or the last day of the month
(when selecing a the last day of a month)
the page about switch in javascript may come in handy)

create a function that pops a snackbar when the user tries to creat a new event
with forever and daily/weekday/weekly, asking them to change it or use daily task
---


Add explanation/description about the importance

create a table on index for the listtodo that allows to scroll through it's list
without scrolling the window, also add diferent options for order it by and filters

In cellphones, allows the index to focus only in the list or parts of the daily stuff at time (?)
Moves the listtodo to a sidenav (?)https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp

add a mini calendar to the top right and
create a sidenav that show a few of the closest important event and
 the most urgents stuff https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp

Create a deadline option on urgency, which also open option telling when the
urgency show change compared to how close the deadline is.

and all the manytomany parts.
(in doubts ?  check views.test and models.daily.clean) 


remember to set the auto test date to month + 1
